I always wanted to create one but I don't have the guts and too scared to bash by other people with my poor English but I realize to ignore them and just write whatever comes in my mind. I really do have poor English education from Grade school up to my College years my classmates always laugh at me whenever I speak English, maybe because I'm the person that's not serious and always do practical jokes so all I do is joke to them. As part of improving my English I will post 2-3 articles a month about travel, programming, food etc. And also feedback is good just email me at mr.genesis.tadeo@gmail.com Thank you :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
